      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing blogs when I was a shcool kid. I was in class 8 or 9 when I first signed up for Blogger
and created my first blog. The concept of writing a journal that can be read by anyone from anywhere in the
world was a thrilling idea for me then. I did not have full time internet access then. On my way to school,
I used to visit a cyber cafe and browse the internet for sometimes. It was quite costly then and I was a
student. I could not afford much time. Soon Grameen Phone launched their WAP service and Blogger had a
feature to publish blog posts via email. I used to login to Gmail via a 3rd party mobile app named &amp;ldquo;gmail-mobile&amp;rdquo;
kindly hosted by Neerav Modi on &lt;a href=&#34;http://sayni.net&#34;&gt;http://sayni.net&lt;/a&gt;. I soon started this service to ocassionally put my thoughts
and daily stories on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember when, but at one point, I was getting frustrated with Blogger and switched to WordPress. By
then I have started writing some codes and started using Linux for my development work. I also got my personal
domain name - &amp;ldquo;masnun.com&amp;rdquo;. So I moved to a self hosted version of WordPress. It was fun and liberating.
There were so many cool plugins and beautiful themes. I could do so much!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, my blog has been hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://masnun.com&#34;&gt;http://masnun.com&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes on &lt;a href=&#34;http://masnun.me&#34;&gt;http://masnun.me&lt;/a&gt; (I was over excited
to have the &lt;code&gt;.me&lt;/code&gt; domain but I got back to the &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; after some times. Both were basically the same website,
powered by WordPress.  By the mean time, I have experimented with some stuff and got banned from Adsense
and later reddit. I also lost my rank on Google Search because of switching the domain names time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time passed by, I started writing technical stuff and my blog started seeing traffic. Today my old blog at
masnun.com gets on average 600+ visits per day, all from search engines. My blog was also accepted to the Planet
Python and some of my technical blog posts got featured in several places. I realized people do read good
content and saw a renewed interest in blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, despite the many cool features of WordPress, I kept feeling the need of something really lightweight
fast. So I decided to choose a static site generator. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to lose the rank or traffic to
masnun.com, so I chose a new domain as well - &lt;a href=&#34;http://masnun.rocks&#34;&gt;http://masnun.rocks&lt;/a&gt; - call me a narcissist, but the domain is
pretty cool, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am, looking for a new beginning. This blog would be powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;
which is an excellent static site generator with a large community. It is written in &lt;code&gt;Golang&lt;/code&gt; and extremely
fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, I mostly write technical content. This new blog would be no different. But I would try to write
elaborate, in depth blog posts instead of the code snippet focused posts on my old blog.&lt;/p&gt;
