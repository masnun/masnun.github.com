I am a business graduate, *nix fan, open source enthusiast, fast learner, early adopter, team guy, explorer, deeply driven, self motivated software craftsman.

I love music, hacking and playing urban terror. I contribute to open source projects at leisure. I would love to pursue challenging opportunities which contribute to a better tomorrow for all of us!

## What is in my skill set?

I am a __full stack developer__ with extensive experience in __system administration__. I have played with a lot of tools and toys. However, I would call these my primary skills:

**Python:** <br/>
You can call me a dedicated Python Developer. I love all things Python. I have 4 years of working experience with different Python tools and toys.

* Django
* Django Rest Framework
* Flask 
* Celery
* Scrapy
* BeautifulSoup
* Google App Engine
* Kivy
* PyQT / PySide



**PHP:** <br/>
PHP has been my primary stack for a long time. I started doing professional PHP development since late 2008. I still enjoy writing PHP, specially with the new syntax, language features and modern frameworks - PHP is still fun to me.

* Laravel 
* Symfony
* Zend (1.x)
* Code Igniter
* WordPress
* Guzzle



**Front End:**<br/> 
I have mostly worked as a backend developer during my career over the past 7-8 years. But I have had my share of front end development too. I am definitely __not__ a kickass front end ninja but I do know more than enough HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build decent Web UIs and mobile applications.

* JavaScript
* jQuery 
* AngularJS (1.x)
* ReactJS
* Bootstrap

I am learning `ES2015` and beyond for writing cleaner codes. 

__Tool Set:__ <br/> 
I know __git__ and work on __OS X__. I have __Linux VMs__  running inside __Vagrant__. I am also a big fan of __Docker__ and find it a painless solution to develop and deploy my applications. I have working experience with __MySQL__, __PostgreSQL__ and __NoSQLs__ as well. I have scored __95%__ in __MongoDB__ course from __Mongo University__.  I will not only __build__ your app but also __deploy__ it to cloud providers like heroku, aws, rackspace or any VPS.

I am a believer in __code quality__ and follow the best practices. I use __Jetbrains IDEs__ for optimum productivity and cleaner codes. I believe every developer should write __unit tests__ before starting to write business logic. __BDD__ and __TDD__ are my super secret ninja skills against bugs. 

While I am mostly focused on Python, PHP and Javascript, I love learning new technologies and adapt new tools to solve challenging problems. I have decent expertise in these tools too: 


__Node.js:__<br/>
I of course use Node.js as a part of my front end tooling but I also love building simple backends using it. I love the `npm` package managers for it's simplicity. 

* Express 
* SailsJS
* MEAN 
* Keystone JS
* `requests` module for scraping

<br/>
__Redis:__ I have used it as message queue, cache and data store. 

__Golang:__ I am a big fan of itâ€™s concurrency model, simple syntax and a nice standard library. I have written several command line tools in the language. Cross compilation and the `go fmt` tool is a big plus for me. 

## What do I want to learn next? 

* Machine Learning 
* Data Science
* Natural Language Processing

## How can I add value to your business?

I have a __business degree__ (and currently doing __MBA__). I have a very keen interest in __growth hacking__. I try to understand the business process and __add values__ to both customers and the business. I assume __ownership__ and __lead by example__. I understand the importance of __shipping fast__ and capture the market before competitors. I think __out of the box__ and bring __novelty__ to the table.

I translate the __business requirements__ into __agile__ software development practices and stride to achieve enhanced __value creation__ for all of us!
